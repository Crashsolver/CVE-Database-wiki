After downloading the executable, move it to the C:\Users\<your logon account> directory. 

Then execute the program. If your Windows security says that the program is "unsigned", tell it that it is okay to execute.

A new directory will be created called CVE. Within that directory will reside the database file as well as two directories called DAT and CSV.
