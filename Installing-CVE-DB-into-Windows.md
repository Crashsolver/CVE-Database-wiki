After downloading the executable, move it to the C:\Users\<your logon account> directory. 

Then execute the program. If your Windows security says that the program is "unsigned", tell it that it is okay to execute.

A new directory will be created called CVE. Within that directory will reside the database file as well as three directories called DAT, CSV and REPORTS. If the database is missing, it will create a new one.
