CVE-database accepts 2 type of files for import. The first type is a data file *.dat from Exam Tools specifically tailored for the W5YI VEC. That file can only be downloaded by the CVE or the designated co-owner. 

The second type is the common CSV file (Comma Separated Value). The CSV can either be the applicant CSV session file downloaded from Exam Tools or a CSV file exported from a spreadsheet. (assuming the column names have been adjusted)


The *.dat files are copied into the CVE/DAT directory. The *.csv files are copied into the CVE/CSV directory. In the "file" section of the menu, you simply click on the appropriate import button. Once the files are imported, CVE-Database will delete the files so as to help prevent the accidental double import of the same data.
