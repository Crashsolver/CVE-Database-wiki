CVE-database accepts 2 type of files for import. The first type is a data file *.json from Exam Tools Downloads / JSON Export. That file can only be downloaded by the CVE or the designated co-CVE. 

The second type is the common CSV file (Comma Separated Value). The CSV can either be the applicant CSV session file downloaded from Exam Tools or a CSV file exported from a spreadsheet. (assuming the column names have been adjusted)


The _**.json files are copied into the appropriate CVE/JSON**_ sub-directory. The JSON sub-directories are labeled per VEC. The *.csv files are copied into the CVE/CSV directory. In the "file" section of the menu, you simply click on the appropriate import button. Once the files are imported, CVE-Database will delete the files so as to help prevent the accidental double import of the same data.

If you have JSON files from several different VEC sessions, copy all of the files into the correct JSON sub-directories. CVE-DB will check all VEC sub-directories for files to import. No need to do separate imports per VEC. Empty directories are ignored.

Speaking about duplicate imports, I recommend that you flex the power of your computer's OS. Use the VEC designated directory (like JSON_W5YI or JSON_ARRL as examples) and copy all the appropriate VEC JSON files into that directory. If there are duplicate files, your OS will flag the duplicates. Remove any duplicates before you import into the database. Once you have completed the import, simply start CVE-DB and look at the right panel. The last imported session date will be listed at the top of the panel.
