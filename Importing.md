CVE-database accepts 2 type of files for import. The first type is a data file output from Exam Tools specifically tailored for the W5YI VEC. That file can only be downloaded by the CVE or the designated co-owner. The second type is the common CSV file (Comma Separated Value). The CSV can either be the applicant CSV session file downloaded from Exam Tools or a CSV file exported from a spreadsheet. (assuming the column names have been adjusted)
