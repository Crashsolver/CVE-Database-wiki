## CVE (Contact Volunteer Examiner)  
is the term used by the W5YI VEC to indicate the lead VE of a VE team. ARRL calls that same position, the Liaison Volunteer Examiner. Other VEC organizations may refer to this position as the Session Manager for the VE team. For the purpose of discussion, this person will be referred to as the CVE.

Since the pandemic, a new tool for VE teams is the web-based [Exam Tools](https://examtools.org/) and the web-based study site, [Hamstudy.org](https://hamstudy.org).  **Exam Tools** is a VE documentation web-based support tool. 

In the past and to some degree in the present, VE teams administered a exam session using paper exams. The overall process could take a very long time to administer. Then there is the long time involved with mailing the paperwork to the respective VEC organization along with the possibility of the paperwork getting "lost in the mail".

By computerizing the overall process, **Exam Tools** reduces the administrative tasks to a few digitally signed mouse clicks. **The time to do paperwork is reduced by 95%** or higher. The output files are digitally signed and uploaded by the CVE to his/her respective VEC organization. The time for a candidate to take their exam and get their new license or upgrade can be as little as a 2 - 3 days verses the weeks it can take with pure paperwork.

The CVE can take the VEC session output files from Exam Tools and import the candidate data into a searchable database using this program.

Why use this program when an Excel or LibreOffice spreadsheet can do the same?

1) Ease of importing the data

2) Very flexible search terms which could be extremely hard, if not impossible, to do with a spreadsheet


You will notice that CVE-DB does not have **delete** nor **update** functionality. The imported files are a historical snapshot of an exam session. There is no valid reason to include such functions. Furthermore, data imported into the database is very limited. Just enough to assist you. If you need more data about your sessions, I recommend installing a database server like Mysql or PostgreSQL and taking time to learn the SQL language.
