* [Home Directory]
*    --->CVE, program directory in the home directory
*    -----> JSON, a sub-directory in the CVE directory: listed by VEC (JSON_ARRL as an example)
*    -----> CSV, a sub-directory in the CVE directory
*    -----> REPORTS, a subdirectory in CVE for holding reports based on SQL queries.
