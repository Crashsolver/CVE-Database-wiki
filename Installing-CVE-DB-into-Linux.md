Download the CVE-DB.bin file (not the CVE-DB.exe file) and place it into the 'bin' directory for your home directory. Rename CVE-DB.bin to CVE-DB and execute the program. The program will automatically add the CVE, CVE/CSV, CVE/JSON_"VEC" and CVE/REPORTS directories to your home directory. If the database is missing, it will create a new one.
