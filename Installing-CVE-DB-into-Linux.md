Download the CVE-DB file (not the CVE-DB.exe file) and place it into the 'bin' directory for your home directory. Execute the program. The program will automatically add the CVE, CVE/CSV, CVE/JSON and CVE/REPORTS directories to your home directory. If the database is missing, it will create a new one.

If you do not have PANDAS installed with Python 3.8, you can install PANDAS in a terminal window using this command:

pip install pandas

**Note:** Updates of CVE-DB are very easy. Simply replace the executable with the newer executable. If the database needs re-building, a note will be included in the ChangeLog file.
