Download the CVE-DB file (not the CVE-DB.exe file) and place it into the 'bin' directory for your home directory. Execute the program. The program will automatically add the CVE, CVE/CSV, CVE/JSON_<VEC> and CVE/REPORTS directories to your home directory. If the database is missing, it will create a new one.

If you do not have PANDAS installed with Python 3.8, you can install PANDAS in a terminal window using this command:

pip install pandas
