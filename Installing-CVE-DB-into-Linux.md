Download the CVE-DB file (not the CVE-DB.exe file) and place it into the 'bin' directory for your home directory. Execute the program. The program will automatically add the CVE, CVE/CSV, CVE/DAT and CVE/REPORTS directories to your home directory. If the database is missing, it will create a new one.
