If you have a pre-existing spreadsheet which you would like to import into the CVE-database program, the column names will need to be adjusted to match the fields below. I suggest that you make a copy of your spreadsheet and work from that copy.


The data fields, used by this program, are listed in proper order below. If a field is missing, add that column to your spreadsheet at the appropriate position. The program automatically handles missing data:

**firstname**: as it indicates, the candidate's first name

**middle**: A middle initial

**lastname**: as it indicates, the candidate's family name

**suffix**: a suffix like Jr or Sr

**email**: their contact email address, FCC requirement

**frn**: the Federal Registration number

**callsign**: for license upgrades

**city**: self-explanatory

**state**: self-explanatory

**E2**: set to **P** if they passed element 2

**E3**: set to **P** if they passed element 3

**E4**: set to **P** if they passed element 4

**sessionDate**: The date were they tested on

**teamId**: The team identification used on Exam Tools
